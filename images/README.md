## Image Requirements

- Product images should be high-quality with transparent backgrounds (PNG format)
- All product images should have a 1:1 aspect ratio for consistent display
- Recommended resolution: At least 1000x1000 pixels
- Images should be optimized for web (compressed without losing quality)
- Payment icons should be in SVG format for scalability

## Optimization Tips

1. Use tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or Squoosh to compress images
2. Keep file sizes under 200KB when possible
3. Consider using WebP format with PNG fallbacks for better performance
4. Use SVG for icons and logos when possible

## Folder Organization

- `/images/products/` - Product images
- `/images/accessories/` - Accessory images
- `/images/icons/` - Icons and logos
- `/images/payment/` - Payment method logos
